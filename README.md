# Istio Impact: Unveiling Istio in Local Kubernetes

Welcome to **Istio Impact** â€“ a project designed to shed light on the powerful features of Istio within the context of a local Kubernetes cluster. By running a sample application on a local Kind Kubernetes cluster, we aim to showcase the diverse capabilities of Istio and its significance in modern microservices architecture.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find a step-by-step guide and associated resources to demonstrate Istio's features, all within the comfortable environment of a Kind Kubernetes cluster. Here's what we cover in this project:

1. **Sample Application**: We begin by deploying a sample application in a Kind Kubernetes cluster. This application serves as our playground for exploring Istio's features.

2. **Initializing Istio**: To harness Istio's telemetry and observability features, we walk you through the process of initializing the Istio system within a Minikube cluster.

3. **Istio Injection**: We demonstrate the method to inject Istio into our Kubernetes namespace, allowing you to manage and secure your application with Istio.

4. **Kubernetes Configuration**: We provide service and deployment YAML files for your application to ensure it is Istio-enabled and fully controlled by the service mesh.

5. **Ingress Gateway**: Learn how to set up an Ingress Gateway to control external access to your services while enjoying the benefits of Istio's features like routing and security policies.

6. **Circuit Breaker Configuration**: Dive into Istio's circuit breaker feature and explore how it can enhance the reliability and resilience of your services.

## Key Concepts Explored

As part of this project, you will explore several key concepts and features of Istio, including:

- **Weighted Routing**: Understand how Istio can be used to control traffic distribution to different versions of your application.

- **Canaries**: Experiment with deploying canary releases of your application to gain insights into gradual rollouts and feature testing.

- **Telemetry**: Explore Istio's telemetry and observability capabilities to gain valuable insights into your services' behavior.
